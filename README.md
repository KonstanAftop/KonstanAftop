Hey there! I'm a university student based in Indonesia, majoring in Meteorology with a minor in Data Science and AI. I'm driven by a deep curiosity about the atmosphere and a passion for transforming data into actionable insights.

Python is my go-to toolkit — whether it's automating workflows, analyzing complex datasets, or building machine learning models. I’m fluent in data science libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow, and I specialize in meteorological spatial data with tools like xarray and cartopy.

My ultimate goal? To bridge the gap between environmental science and machine learning — applying intelligent systems to tackle real-world climate challenges and drive meaningful impact.
